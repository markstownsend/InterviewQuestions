###What design patterns do you know and what is a practical implementation example?	

Design patterns come in 3 types: creational, structural and behavioural. 

#####Creational

* Abstract Factory - Creates an instance of several families of classes
* Builder - Separates object construction from its representation
* Factory Method - Creates an instance of several derived classes
* Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
* Singleton - A class in which only a single instance can exist

To remember: ABFPS.  Abraham became first president (of the united) states.

#####Structural

* Adaptor - Matches interfaces of different classes 
* Bridge - Separates an object's interface from it's implementation
* Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
* Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically/ without recompiling the object
* Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
* Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
* Proxy - An object representing another object

To remember: ABCDFFP

#####Behavioural

* Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes
* Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
* Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program
* Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
* Chain of Responsibility - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
* Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
* State - Alter an object's behaviour when its state changes
* Strategy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
* Observer - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
* Template Method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
* Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change

There are also message based design patterns: 

* Fire and Forget 
* Request-Response
* Pub-Sub.

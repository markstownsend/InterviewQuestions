###What design principles do you know?	

#####SOLID

* Single Responsibility Principle - A class/ member should only have one reason to change
* Open Closed Principle - A class should be open for extension but closed for modification
* Liskov Substitution Principle - All base types should be substitutable for their sub types
* Interface Segregation Principle - Lots of smaller, discreet interfaces are better than one monolithic interface
* Dependency Inversion Principle - One should depend on abstractions and not the detailed implementations

#####DRY

* Don't repeat yourself

#####YAGNI

* You ain't gonna need it!

#####Rule of Three

* A code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when a replicated piece of code should be replaced by a new procedure.  Code can only be copied once.  When the same code is used 3 times it must be extracted into a new procedure.
